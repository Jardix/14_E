		<h1>14.1 Exercise</h1>
		<div class="container">
			<h2>1.) What is HTTP?</h2>
			<p>
				HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol; it allows different
				machines to communicate across the web.
			</p>
			<h2>Answer:</h2>
			<p>
				Hyper Text Transfer Protocol is governs how clients get data from, or
				send data to, a server.
			</p>
			<h2>2.) What is a URL?</h2>
			<p>A URL is a 'nickname' for an address on the web.</p>
			<h2>Answer:</h2>
			<p>
				Short for Uniform Resource Locator, a URL is an address for some
				internet resource.
			</p>
			<h2>3.) What is DNS?</h2>
			<p>DNS is a naming system for machines connected to the internet.</p>
			<h2>Answer:</h2>
			<p>
				Short for Domain Name System, this is a system that takes human-readable
				URLs and converts them into IP addresses.
			</p>
			<h2>4.) What is a query string?</h2>
			<p>
				A query string is information used to modify the view of the webpage or
				resource you're requesting.
			</p>
			<h2>Answer:</h2>
			<p>
				The query string allows you to pass key-value pairs into the URL, in the
				format ?key1=value1&key2=value2...
			</p>
			<h2>5.) What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?</h2>
			<p>
				GET and POST are two HTTP Verbs; 'GET' requests information from a
				server, POST gives information to that server for storage or
				modification.
			</p>
			<h2>Answer:</h2>
			<p>
				GET - get some data from the server (most pages, search forms) POST -
				send some data to the server (pages that change data on server)
			</p>
			<h2>6.) What is an HTTP request?</h2>
			<p>
				It is a task to be done on a resource or page. Searching a website, for
				example.
			</p>
			<h2>Answer:</h2>
			<p>
				An HTTP request is a request from a client to a server which follows the
				HTTP protocol (eg a request for HTML from news.google.com)
			</p>
			<h2>7.) What is an HTTP response?</h2>
			<p>
				A page, or other group of information given from the server to the
				machine that made the request.
			</p>
			<h2>Answer:</h2>
			<p>
				An HTTP response is a response from a server to a client which follows
				the HTTP protocol (eg sending back HTML/CSS/JS/etc)
			</p>
			<h2>
				8.) What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and
				response headers you have seen.
			</h2>
			<p>Don't have a good answer. Referring to solution.</p>
			<h2>Answer:</h2>
			<p></p>
			<h2>
				9.) What are the processes that happen when you type
				“http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
			</h2>
			<p>
				Your machine sends a 'GET" request to a server, that server may or may
				not send a request to a database, that server than sends the requested
				information back to your machine.
			</p>
			<h2>Anser:</h2>
			<p>
				Your browser “resolves” the name into an IP address using DNS Your
				browser makes a request to that IP address, including headers (info
				about browser, any previous cookies, and other things) The server sends
				a response (typically, HTML, with a status code (200 if it was
				sucessful) The browser makes a DOM from that HTML, and finds any other
				resources needed (images, CSS, JavaScript, etc) The browser makes
				separate HTTP requests for those resources and receives response from
				the server for each
			</p>
			<h1>Part 2: Practice Tools</h1>
			<h2>
				1.) Using curl, make a GET request to the icanhazdadjoke.com API to find
				all jokes involving the word “pirate”
			</h2>
			<p>
				There was no solution for this, and even after watching a Youtube video,
				I couldn't get it to work.
			</p>
			<h2>2.) Use dig to find what the IP address is for icanhazdadjoke.com</h2>
			<p>
				Googled how to use DIG. Got a total of three addresses: <br />
				104.21.37.176 <br />
				172.67.211.64 <br />
				172.23.80.1<br />
			</p>
			<h2>
				3.) Make a simple web page and serve it using python3 -m http.server.
				Visit the page in a browser.
			</h2>
			<p>This I managed to do, but don't know how to prove it.</p>
			<h1>Part 3</h1>
			<h2>
				1.) Build a very simple HTML form that uses the GET method (it can use
				the same page URL for the action) when the form is submitted.
				<br /><br />
				2.) Add a field or two to the form and, after submitting it, explore in
				Chrome Developer tools how you can view the request and response
				headers. <br /><br />
				3.) Edit the page to change the form type to POST, refresh in the
				browser and re-submit. Do you still see the field in the query string?
				Explore in Chrome how you can view the request and response headers, as
				well as the form data
			</h2>
            <p>I wouldn't know how to begin to accomplish this.</p>
			<h1>Part 4:</h1>
			<p>This didn't appear to be an exercise.</p>
